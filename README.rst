Plot ensemble dust properties
=============================

Plot the ensemble properties of difference dust extinction samples.
Basic idea is to have one place to put together the A(V), R(V), E(B-V),
FM90 UV extinction parameters, and any other parameters for different
samples of dust extinction curves.  Examples of such samples are those
from Gordon et al. (2003) and Valencic et al. (2004).
