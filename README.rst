Plot ensemble dust properties
=============================

Plot the ensemble properties of difference dust extinction samples.
Basic idea is to have one place to put together the A(V), R(V), E(B-V),
FM90 UV extinction parameters, and any other parameters for different
samples of dust extinction curves.  Examples of such samples are those
from Gordon et al. (2003), Valencic et al. (2004), Fitzpatrick et al. (2007).

Sample Data
-----------

The sample data is given in an IPAC ASCII data table in the data directory.
These tables should have at least A(V), E(B-V), and R(V) values.

Where needed, code is provided to convert the original data tables to a common
format for this repository (e.g., `data/process_valencic04.py`).

Plots
-----

plot_param_vs_param: plot combination of FM90 parameters E(B-V), A(V), E(B-V),
  N(HI), N(HI)/E(B-V), etc. versus each other depending on commandline parameters

plot_1d_distributions: plot the 1D histograms of a FM90 parameter for specified
  datasets

Data
----

Includes literature data and options for plotting one, two, or many datasets.
